## User Guide

![Alt text](/MainPage.png?raw=true "The Main Page")

SOT is brainchild of 4 student developers as a way to make the searching of information for the university easier. It is supposed to be used in addition with the official websites of the university to find any information regarding the administrative part of the studies.

The FAQ page, as the name suggests, is there to answer the frequently asked questions. It covers topics from Neptun code to how the grading system works. It is ever-growing and there will be many more questions added to it as we progress.

Appointment page is there for students if they want to set up an appointment with student coordinators. The students can select the date and time based on the availability of the coordinators.

SOT chatbot is there to help you with your concerns which cannot be found on the FAQ page. It can guide you about many topics and also crack a joke once in a while if you ask it to do so.

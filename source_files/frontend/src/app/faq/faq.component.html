        <div class="uk-accordion-content">
            <P>The Hungarian academic credit system following the Hungarian law is an ECTS-compatible system. The calculation of the credits is based on the number of working hours of the students (one credit is 30 student working hours, on average). 
                At the end of the semester, the student’s study achievement is evaluated with a grade (5-excellent, 4-good, 3-medium or satisfactory, 2-sufficient or pass, 1-fail). The ECTS conversion table ensures transfer procedures between the Hungarian academic credit system and the ECTS. The recognition of courses completed abroad is based on the credit transfer regulation.
